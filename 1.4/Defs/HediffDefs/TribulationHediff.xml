    <description>This being is undergoing Tribulation, the punishment of Heaven upon those that oppose its will. During tribulation their movement is slowed immensely. If they have a Dao Pool, its energy will be converted into progression on their Ascendant Foundation or Psuedo-Immortality if the Foundation tier is XII. During every convsersion they are struck with non-damaging lightning. If the tribulation continues with less than 1 dao energy to convert, or they have the final tier of psuedo-immortality, they will be struck by damaging lightning and the tribulation will end.</description>
